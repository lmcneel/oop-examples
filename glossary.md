# Glossary

## Terminology

- **Class**: A template for creating objects, defining common structure and behavior.
- **Object / Instance**: A concrete realization of a class.
- **Property / Field**: A variable defined within a class.
- **Method**: A function defined within a class.
- **Constructor**: A special method used to initialize new instances of a class.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details and exposing only necessary interfaces.
- **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects of different types to be accessed through a uniform interface.
- **Abstraction**: Highlighting essential qualities, ignoring the irrelevant details. In TypeScript, this often means using interfaces and abstract classes.
- **Composition**: Building more complex functionality by combining multiple simpler objects.

## Core OOP Concepts

1. Classes and Instances:
  - Class: A blueprint that defines the properties and methods for objects of its type.
  - Instance (Object): A specific occurrence of a class created using the new keyword.
2. Encapsulation:
  - Bundling related data (properties) and behaviors (methods) together inside classes, and controlling access to that data using visibility modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected in TypeScript).
3. Inheritance:
  - Creating a new class that extends an existing class, thereby reusing and customizing its properties and methods. This promotes code reuse and establishes hierarchical relationships.
4. Polymorphism:
  - The ability of objects of different classes related by inheritance to respond differently to the same method call. In other words, the method name stays the same, but the behavior can differ depending on the object calling it.
5. Composition:
  - Building complex objects by combining simpler ones. Instead of inheriting from a single "superclass," you assemble objects from smaller parts that each handle a specific responsibility.
